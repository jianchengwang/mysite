# **100篇K12口语练习素材**

引言：通过日常日记和英语语块解锁流利口语

资源目的：  
本资源旨在为K12阶段的学习者提供真实、有趣的材料，帮助他们提升英语口语的流利度。  
资源形式为100篇简短的第一人称日记，模拟典型的K12学生生活体验。  
重点培养的技能包括：朗读、跟读（shadowing）、复述以及内化自然的语言模式。  
英语语块（English Chunks）的力量：  
“语块”是指由多个单词组成的单位（如搭配、固定短语、句子开头语），母语者常将其作为一个整体来使用 。例如：get ready for（为……做准备），hang out with（和……一起玩），a lot of（许多），kind of（有点儿）。  
语块对于提升流利度至关重要。研究表明，语言在很大程度上是基于词汇和语块的 。使用语块可以减轻认知负担，让学习者说得更流畅、更自然 ，这与逐字造句的方式形成对比。  
教学侧重： 优先选择高频功能性语块，而非复杂的习语。  
研究显示，像 "you know"（你知道的）、"I think"（我认为）、"I don't know"（我不知道）、"kind of"（有点儿）、"a lot of"（许多）这类语块的使用频率极高 ，它们通常承担着语用功能，如进行委婉表达或标记话语 。虽然习语（如 "kick the bucket" \- 去世 ）也是英语的一部分 ，但许多习语使用频率较低，且对初学者来说更难理解。对于旨在提升基础流利度的K12学习者而言，掌握日常对话中常见的功能性、结构性高频语块（如  中列举的）比投入大量精力学习复杂习语能更快见到成效 。  
因此，这些日记将在叙述中策略性地、自然地融入这些高频功能性语块，而不是生硬地塞入不常用或可能引起困惑的习语。  
如何使用这些日记：  
建议的实用方法：

* **朗读（Read Aloud）：** 练习发音和节奏。  
* **跟读（Shadowing）：** 听录音（如果提供或自行制作）并跟说。  
* **语块识别（Chunk Spotting）：** 在每篇日记中找出目标语块（可对照附录）。  
* **复述（Retelling）：** 用自己的话总结日记内容，尝试使用其中的语块。  
* **个性化（Personalization）：** 鼓励学生结合自身经历改写日记。

强调持之以恒：建议规律练习以达到最佳效果，因为重复有助于语块的习得 。  
资源结构： 简要说明日记所依据的主题分类。  
**第一部分：校园时光 (School Days) (约15篇)**

焦点： 与学校相关的日常活动、课堂体验、与同学老师的互动、家庭作业以及常见的学校活动。这些是K12学生非常熟悉的主题 。  
内容示例与语块融入：

* 准备上学： 起床、吃早餐、整理书包。语块：wake up (起床), get ready for school (准备上学), have breakfast (吃早餐), pack my bag (整理书包), run late (快迟到了), on time (准时)。(反映了日常作息 )。  
* 课堂之中： 听老师讲课、参与活动、小组合作、特定科目（数学、英语、科学、美术）。语块：pay attention (注意听讲), take notes (记笔记), work together (一起合作), figure out (弄明白), ask a question (问问题), good at (擅长), find it tricky (觉得有点难) 。  
* 午餐与休息： 吃午饭、和朋友玩耍、聊天。语块：have lunch (吃午饭), hang out with friends (和朋友一起玩), talk about (谈论), play games (玩游戏), have fun (玩得开心)。(反映了社交互动主题 )。  
* 家庭作业与学习： 做作业、感觉疲惫、需要帮助。语块：do homework (做作业), study for a test (复习备考), feel tired (感觉累), need help with (在……方面需要帮助), get it done (完成), call it a day (今天就到这里吧) 。  
* 老师与朋友： 喜欢某个老师、和同学相处融洽、小分歧。语块：get along with (和……相处融洽), helpful (有帮助的), explain things (解释事情), have a disagreement (有分歧), make up (和好)。(使用了互动短语 )。

教学启示：通过相关场景将语块情境化能促进习得。  
仅仅记忆语块列表（如  中所示）的效果不如在有意义的语境中接触它们 。学校生活为K12学习者提供了一个丰富而熟悉的语境。当像 figure out (弄明白) 这样的语块出现在一篇关于解决数学难题的日记中时，它比孤立学习时更容易被记住，用法也更清晰。这与通过在语境中反复接触来自然吸收语法和词汇的观点一致 。  
因此，每篇日记都会将语块嵌入具体、易于理解的学校情境中，最大化有意义吸收的可能性。

### **1.1 A Busy Morning**

Today was such a rush hour\! I almost ran late for school. I woke up a little late, so I had to get ready for school super fast. I quickly had breakfast, just some toast and milk. Then I grabbed my backpack and ran to the bus stop. Luckily, the bus was still there\! I need to remember to set my alarm earlier tomorrow. I don't want to start the day feeling so stressed. Being on time is much better.

### **1.2 My Favorite Subject**

English class is definitely my favorite subject. Today, we read a really interesting story. Our teacher, Ms. Davis, is so nice and always explains things clearly. We had to work together in small groups to discuss the characters. I got along with my group members well. We had to figure out the main idea of the story. I think I'm pretty good at understanding stories. I always look forward to English class. It's so much fun.

### **1.3 Lunchtime Fun**

Lunchtime is the best\! I always hang out with my best friends, Lily and Tom. Today, we had lunch together in the cafeteria. I had a sandwich and an apple. After eating, we went outside to play games. We played tag for a little bit. It was so much fun running around. We talked about our plans for the weekend. I can't wait for Saturday\! Lunch break always goes by too fast.

### **1.4 Math Problem**

Math class was a bit tricky today. We learned about fractions. At first, I didn't understand it very well. The teacher explained it again, and I tried to pay attention. I had to ask a question about one problem. My friend Sarah helped me out. Finally, I started to figure it out. It felt good to understand something difficult. I still need to practice more when I do homework tonight.

### **1.5 After School**

School finished at 3:30 PM today. I felt tired after all the classes. I walked home with my friend, Mark. We talked about the soccer game we watched last night. When I got home, I had a snack – some cookies and juice. Then, it was time to do homework. I had quite a lot of homework today, especially math. I hope I can get it done before dinner. I look forward to relaxing later.

### **1.6 Group Project**

In science class, we started a group project about planets. I'm working with Amy and Ben. We need to work together to make a poster. First, we discussed which planet to choose. We decided on Mars. Then, we planned what information to include. Amy is good at drawing, so she will draw the pictures. Ben and I will look up information online and write the text. I think we will make a good team. I hope we do a good job.

### **1.7 Feeling Nervous**

Tomorrow, I have to give a short presentation in history class. I feel nervous just thinking about it\! I have to talk about ancient Egypt for two minutes. I practiced it a few times at home tonight in front of the mirror. My mom listened too and said I did well. But I still have butterflies in my stomach. I hope it goes well tomorrow. I need to remember to speak slowly and clearly. Wish me luck\!

### **1.8 Art Class Fun**

Art class is always so much fun. Today, we learned how to mix colors. We used paint to create different shades. I really like painting. I painted a picture of a sunset with lots of orange, pink, and purple. The teacher said it looked beautiful\! It made me feel happy and proud of myself. I love being creative. I can't wait for the next art class. Maybe we'll use clay next time\!

### **1.9 A Substitute Teacher**

Our regular English teacher, Mrs. Green, was sick today, so we had a substitute teacher. His name was Mr. Evans. He seemed nice, but it felt a little bit different. He gave us some worksheets to do quietly. It wasn't as fun as our usual lessons. I missed Mrs. Green. I hope she gets well soon. It's always better when our regular teacher is here. Things just feel more normal.

### **1.10 Studying for a Test**

We have a science test on Friday. Oh no\! I need to study for the test tonight and tomorrow. There are a lot of things to remember about plants and animals. I made some flashcards to help me. My dad said he would quiz me later. I hope I do well. Tests always make me a bit worried. I'll try my best to review everything. Fingers crossed\!

### **1.11 Library Visit**

Our class went to the library today during school. I love the library\! It's so quiet, and there are so many books. I borrowed two books. One is an adventure story, and the other is about dinosaurs. I can't wait to start reading them tonight. Our librarian, Mrs. Gable, is very helpful. She always helps us find books we like. Reading is one of my favorite things to do.

### **1.12 Fire Drill**

We had a fire drill at school today. The alarm bell rang really loudly\! We all had to line up quickly and walk outside to the field. We practiced it before, so everyone knew what to do. We waited outside for a few minutes until the teachers said it was okay to go back inside. It's important to practice so we know how to be safe in case of a real fire. It was a bit noisy, though\!

### **1.13 School Assembly**

This morning, we had a school assembly in the big hall. The principal talked about upcoming events. Then, the school choir sang a few songs. They sounded really good\! My friend, Lisa, is in the choir. I felt proud of her. Assemblies are okay, but sometimes they feel a little bit long. It was nice to see the whole school together, though. It makes you feel part of the community.

### **1.14 Lost and Found**

I lost my favorite blue pencil case today\! I looked for it everywhere after lunch, but I couldn't find it. I felt sad and a bit worried. I asked my teacher, and she suggested checking the Lost and Found box. And guess what? It was there\! Phew\! I was so relieved. I need to be careful  with my things and make sure I don't lose them again. I put my name on it now.

### **1.15 Last Day Before Break**

Today was the last day of school before the spring break\! Everyone was so excited. Teachers didn't give us much homework. In the afternoon, we watched a movie in class. It was a nice way to end the term. I said goodbye to my friends and wished them a happy holiday. I can't wait for the break to start. I have lots of plans\! School is okay, but breaks are awesome\!

**第二部分：家庭生活 (At Home with Family) (约15篇)**

教学启示：在家庭情境中模拟简单的社交互动有助于培养基础对话技能。  
家庭环境是孩子最早学习社交互动模式的地方。日记中描绘简单的家庭对话、请求（Could you please...? 你能……吗？ ）、表达感谢（Thanks so much 非常感谢, I really appreciate it 我真的很感激 ）和道歉（I'm sorry 对不起 ）为K12学习者提供了具体的模仿范例。这些基础互动可以迁移到其他社交场合，如学校或与朋友相处。研究中列出了许多基础对话短语 。  
因此，本部分的日记将在熟悉的家庭场景中巧妙地示范礼貌和常见的互动语言，巩固基础对话的构件。

### **2.1 Weekend Breakfast**

Saturdays are the best because we have breakfast together as a family. Dad made pancakes today\! They were delicious. We all sat around the table and talked about our plans for the day. My sister wants to go to the park. I want to ride my bike. Mom said maybe we can do both\! It's nice to spend time with my family without rushing. Weekday mornings are always so busy. I really appreciate  these slow weekend mornings.

### **2.2 Helping Out**

Mom asked me to help out at home today. My job was to clean my room. To be honest, I didn't really want to, but I knew I had to do my part. I put away my toys, made my bed, and tidied my desk. It took about half an hour. Afterwards, my room looked much better. Mom said, "Thank you so much". It feels good to help. Maybe next time I can help set the table for dinner too.

### **2.6 Evening Routine**

After dinner tonight, I did my homework first. Then, I watched TV with my family for about an hour. We watched a nature show about penguins. It was quite interesting. Around 8:30 PM, Mom told me it was time to get ready for bed. I brushed my teeth, put on my pajamas, and read a book for a little while. Now I feel tired. Time to go to sleep. Good night\!

### **2.7 Cooking Together**

Mom was baking cookies today, and she let me help\! It was so much fun. I helped her mix the ingredients in a big bowl. Flour got everywhere\! Then, I helped cut out the shapes – stars and hearts. The best part was decorating them after they baked. We used icing and sprinkles. The kitchen smelled amazing. We made a big batch, so there's enough to share. Helping cook is awesome\!

### **2.8 A Quiet Sunday**

Today was a very quiet Sunday at home. It was raining outside, so we couldn't go out much. I spent the morning reading my new book. In the afternoon, I played some games with my sister. Dad was reading the newspaper, and Mom was doing some knitting. It was nice just to relax and take it easy. Sometimes, it's good to have a day with nothing much planned. Just chilling out at home.

### **2.9 Bedtime Story**

Every night before I go to sleep, my dad reads me a bedtime story. Tonight, we read a chapter from a fantasy book about dragons. I love listening to his voice. It helps me calm down after the day. Sometimes I fall asleep before the chapter ends\! It's one of my favorite parts of the day. It makes me feel safe and loved. I wonder what will happen next in the story.

### **2.10 Planning a Trip**

My parents are thinking about  planning a family vacation for the summer\! We talked about it during dinner. They asked my sister and me where we would like to go. I said I want to go to the beach.

### **2.11 Learning from Dad**

My dad is teaching me how to play chess. He's really good at it. We played a game this afternoon. Of course , he won easily\! But he explained some strategies to me. He showed me how different pieces move and why some moves are better than others. It's a bit tricky  to remember everything, but I'm trying my best. I hope that one day I can beat him\! It's fun learning something new from him.

### **2.12 Movie Night In**

Friday night is often movie night at our house. Tonight, we ordered pizza and watched a funny animated movie. We all snuggled on the couch with blankets. The movie made us laugh a lot. Pizza and a movie is the perfect way to start the weekend. It's much cozier than going to the cinema sometimes. Plus, you can wear your pajamas\! I really enjoyed spending time together like this.

### **2.13 Tidying the Garden**

The weather was nice today, so we spent some time tidying the garden. Dad was cutting the grass, and Mom was planting some new flowers. My sister and I helped pull out the weeds. It was kind of  hard work, but we worked together. The garden looks much neater now. Afterwards, we played badminton on the lawn. It felt good to get some fresh air and exercise.

### **2.14 Phone Call with Grandma**

My grandma called this evening. I talked to her on the phone for about ten minutes. She asked me how school was going and what I did today. I told her about the cookies Mom and I baked. She sounded happy to hear from me. It's nice to keep in touch with family who live far away. I miss her, but talking on the phone helps. She said she would send me a postcard soon\!

### **2.15 Looking at Old Photos**

Mom found an old photo album today. We spent some time looking through it after dinner. There were pictures of me when I was a baby\! And pictures of my parents when they were young. It was so funny to see their old hairstyles and clothes. We remembered some funny stories from the past. It's interesting to see how much things have changed. It made me feel happy and a little bit nostalgic.

因此，这些日记将使用简单、常见的食物词汇及相关语块，利用该主题固有的相关性和感官联系来帮助记忆。

### **3.1 My Lunchbox**

Today, Mom packed my lunch for school. Inside, I found a cheese sandwich, some carrot sticks, and a small box of juice. Oh, and a chocolate chip cookie for dessert\! Yummy\! I really like it when Mom packs cookies. At lunchtime, I sat with my friends and we talked about what everyone had. Tom had pasta, and Lily had rice balls. It's always interesting to see different lunches. My lunch was pretty good  today.

### **3.2 Favorite Dinner**

Tonight, we had spaghetti for dinner. It's my favorite food in the whole world\! Mom makes the best tomato sauce. I always ask for extra cheese on top. I ate a big plateful. Maybe too much\! I felt stuffed  afterwards, but very happy. Eating my favorite meal always makes me feel good. I helped clear the table after dinner because I enjoyed it so much. I wish we could have spaghetti every night\!

### **3.3 Trying Something New**

My dad cooked dinner tonight, and he made something I'd never tried before. It was a kind of fish curry. At first, I was a bit nervous because I can be a picky eater. But Dad encouraged me to try just a little bit. So I did. And guess what? It was not bad\! It was a little bit spicy, but also sweet. I actually kind of  liked it\! I'm glad I was brave enough to try something new.

### **3.4 Feeling Hungry After School**

I always feel hungry when I get home from school. Today was no different. As soon as I walked in, I went to the kitchen to find a snack. Mom had bought some fresh strawberries. Perfect\! I washed a big bowl of them and ate them all. They were so sweet and juicy. It was much better than having chips or cookies. Fruit gives you energy. Now I feel ready to do my homework.

### **3.5 Baking Cookies**

My sister and I decided to bake cookies this afternoon. We used a simple recipe from Mom's cookbook. We had to mix flour, sugar, butter, and eggs. It got a little messy\! Then we added chocolate chips – lots of them\! We put spoonfuls of dough onto the baking tray. While they were baking, the whole house smelled delicious. They tasted amazing\! We shared them with Mom and Dad later. Baking is fun\!

### **3.6 Eating Out**

Tonight, we didn't cook at home. We decided to eat out  at a nearby pizza place. I love going there\! We looked at the menu, but I already knew what I wanted: a pepperoni pizza. We ordered a large one to share. While waiting, I colored on the paper placemat. The pizza arrived quickly and it was so cheesy and good. Eating out is a nice treat from time to time. It feels special.

### **3.7 I Don't Like Broccoli**

Mom made broccoli for dinner tonight. Honestly, I don't like broccoli very much. The taste is kind of  strong for me. Mom always tells me it's healthy and I should eat it. I tried to eat a few pieces, but I mostly hid them under my mashed potatoes\! My brother loves broccoli, which I don't understand. Maybe one day I'll start liking it, but probably not soon. Everyone has foods they don't go for, right?

### **3.8 Thirsty Work**

We played outside in the garden for a long time this afternoon. It was quite warm, and all that running around made me really thirsty. I came inside and asked Mom for a drink. She gave me a big glass of cold water. It tasted so good\! Sometimes plain water is the best thing when you're thirsty. I drank the whole glass really fast. It's important to drink plenty of water, especially when you're active.

### **3.9 Breakfast Cereal**

Most mornings, I have cereal for breakfast. It's quick and easy before school. I have a few different kinds that I like. Today, I had the crunchy honey nut hoops. I added cold milk and sliced banana on top. It's a pretty good  start to the day. It gives me energy for my morning classes. Sometimes on weekends, Dad makes pancakes or eggs, which is a nice change, but cereal is my usual go-to.

### **3.10 Helping Prepare Salad**

Mom was making a big salad for dinner, and I asked if I could help. She said yes\! She let me wash the lettuce leaves and tear them into smaller pieces. Then, I helped chop some cucumbers (with a safe knife, of course ). I also added cherry tomatoes and some corn. It looked really colorful\! I felt like a real chef. Helping prepare food makes me more interested in eating it too. The salad was delicious\!

**第四部分：爱好与乐趣 (Hobbies and Fun) (约15篇)**

谈论爱好自然会涉及表达偏好（I like, I love, I don't like, I prefer 我喜欢/爱/不喜欢/更喜欢）和能力（I'm good at, I can, I'm learning to 我擅长/会/正在学做）。这为练习这些基础结构及相关语块（例如 really go for 非常喜欢 , good at 擅长 ）提供了绝佳语境。研究片段  涵盖了喜好/厌恶和能力。  
因此，关于爱好的日记将自然地融入并巩固与表达偏好和能力相关的语块，这对个人表达至关重要。

### **4.1 Soccer Practice**

I had soccer practice after school today. It was pretty intense\! Our coach made us do a lot of running drills. Then, we practiced passing and shooting. I scored a goal during the practice game\!

### **4.2 Learning Guitar**

I started learning to play the guitar a few months ago. I have lessons every Tuesday. Today, I practiced the new chords my teacher taught me. My fingers hurt a little bit\! It's not easy, but I really want to learn. I dream of playing my favorite songs one day. For now, I just practice scales and simple tunes. Slowly but surely, I'm getting better. It takes a lot of practice.

### **4.3 Reading a Great Book**

I'm reading such a good book right now\! It's an adventure story about pirates looking for treasure. I can't put it down. I read for almost an hour before bed last night. The characters are brave, and the plot is so exciting. I wonder what will happen next. Reading takes me to different worlds. It's one of my favorite ways to relax. I plan to finish it this weekend if I have time.

### **4.4 Drawing Animals**

In my free time , I love drawing. Today, I decided to draw some animals. I found pictures of lions and elephants online to use as models. I tried my best to make them look realistic. Drawing helps me pay attention to details. It's very calming. I'm not a great artist, but I enjoy doing it. Maybe I'll draw my pet cat next. She's a bit easier because she sits still sometimes\!

### **4.5 Video Game Fun**

My dad let me play video games for an hour this afternoon. I played a racing game on the console. It's so much fun\! I raced against the computer and won a few races. The graphics are amazing, and it feels like you're really driving fast. My dad sometimes plays with me, which is even better. Video games are a fun way to unwind, but I know I shouldn't play for too long.

### **4.6 Riding My Bike**

The weather was perfect today, so I went for a bike ride around the neighborhood. I love the feeling of the wind in my hair. I rode past the park and down to the little stream. It's good exercise and a great way to explore. I saw my friend Emily riding her bike too, so we rode together for a little while. Biking makes me feel free and happy. I need to make sure my tires have enough air next time.

### **4.7 Watching Cartoons**

Saturday morning means cartoons\! I woke up early and turned on the TV. I watched my favorite cartoon show for about an hour while eating breakfast. It's about superheroes who save the city. It's really funny and full of action. It's a nice, lazy way to start the weekend. My parents don't mind me watching a little bit of TV, especially on weekends. It helps me relax before we do other activities.

### **4.8 Building with LEGO**

I spent most of the afternoon building with my LEGO bricks. I decided to build a giant castle. It took a long time and a lot of concentration. I used all sorts of  different colored bricks. I made towers, walls, and even a drawbridge. I felt proud of my creation when it was finished. Building things lets me use my imagination. It's one of my favorite indoor activities, especially when it's raining.

### **4.9 Listening to Music**

While I was doing my homework today, I listened to music. I put on my favorite playlist with upbeat pop songs. It helps me concentrate sometimes, although my mom says it distracts me\! Music just makes everything feel more cheerful. I sometimes sing along quietly if I know the words. I really like discovering new songs and artists. Music can definitely change your mood.

### **4.10 Playing Board Games**

It was raining today, so my sister and I decided to play board games. We played Snakes and Ladders first, which is mostly luck. Then we played Monopoly Junior. That game takes much longer\! We had fun, even though we got a bit competitive about buying properties. Board games are a good way to spend time together indoors. It's better than just watching TV. We laughed a lot.

### **4.11 Practicing Piano**

I have piano lessons every week, so I need to practice almost every day. Today, I practiced for about 20 minutes after school. I played my scales and worked on a new piece. It's a bit tricky  because the timing is fast. Sometimes I get frustrated when I make mistakes, but my teacher says practice makes perfect. I do enjoy playing when I get a piece right. It sounds nice.

### **4.12 Going to the Movies**

My family went to the movies this weekend to see the new animated film. We bought popcorn and drinks – the best part\! The cinema was dark and the screen was huge. The movie was really funny and had a good story. I laughed out loud several times. Going to the cinema feels like a special treat. It's different from watching movies at home. I had a great time with my family.

### **4.13 Nature Walk**

We went for a nature walk in the woods near our house today. It was nice to get some fresh air and be surrounded by trees. We saw some squirrels and heard birds singing. Dad pointed out different types of leaves. It was very peaceful. We walked for about an hour. It's important to spend time in nature. It makes you feel calm and appreciate the world around you.

### **4.14 Learning Magic Tricks**

My uncle showed me a simple magic trick last time he visited. I've been practicing it in my free time. It involves making a coin disappear\! It took me a while to figure out how to do it smoothly. I tried it on my sister today, and she was so surprised\! It felt cool to trick her. Maybe I can learn some more tricks. Being a magician would be awesome\!

### **4.15 Singing Songs**

I love singing\! Sometimes I just sing my favorite songs while I'm playing or drawing. Today, in the car, Mom put on some music, and we both sang along loudly. It doesn't matter if we're good singers or not, it just feels good to sing. It makes me feel happy. We sang a few pop songs and some songs from movies we like. It made the car journey much more fun.

### **5.4 Making a New Friend**

There was a new girl in our class today. Her name is Maya. At first, she seemed a little bit shy. During recess, I went over and said, "Hi, my name is \[Your Name\]." She smiled and told me her name.

### **5.5 Sharing Toys**

We took turns driving it around the living room. He really enjoyed it. Sharing can be hard sometimes, but it makes playing together more fun.

### **5.6 Disagreement During a Game**

My friends and I were playing soccer in the park. During the game, Tom and I had a disagreement about whether the ball was in or out. He said it was out, but I was sure it was in\! We argued for a minute. It kind of  spoiled the fun for a bit. Finally, our friend Ben suggested we just replay the point. That seemed fair. We shook hands and carried on playing. It's silly to argue over games.

### **5.7 Planning a Sleepover**

My best friend, Chloe, and I are planning a sleepover\! We talked about it on the phone tonight. We want to do it next Friday. We need to ask our parents if it's okay. If yes, we plan to watch movies, eat popcorn, and maybe tell ghost stories (not too scary ones\!). I'm so excited about the idea\! Sleepovers are the best. Fingers crossed our parents say yes\! It would be so much fun.

### **5.8 Hanging Out After School**

Sometimes, my friends and I just hang out  in the playground for a little while after school before going home. We don't do anything special, just sit on the benches and talk about our day or tell jokes. It's a nice way to wind down after classes. Today, we talked about the funny thing that happened in math class. It's good to just chat and laugh together. Friends make everything better.

### **5.9 Playing Hide-and-Seek**

A group of us played hide-and-seek during lunch break today. It's such a simple game, but always so much fun. I found a really good hiding spot behind the big tree. It took ages for anyone to find me\! When it was my turn to seek, I ran around trying to spot everyone. Finding people makes you feel clever. We were all laughing and shouting. It's a great game to play together.

### **5.10 Saying Sorry to a Friend**

I accidentally bumped into my friend Lily today and made her drop her books. She looked a bit upset. I immediately said, "I'm so sorry\!  Are you okay?" I helped her pick up her books. She said it was okay, but I still felt bad. It's important to apologize when you make a mistake or hurt someone, even if it's an accident. Being kind to friends is really important. We walked to class together afterwards.

### **6.4 Feeling Tired**

Wow, I feel so tired tonight. We had P.E. class today, and we played running games for almost the whole lesson. Then, after school, I had my swimming lesson. That always makes me worn out.

I'll try to take deep breaths before it starts.

### **6.6 Proud of Myself**

Today in music class, I played my piano piece in front of everyone. I was really nervous before I started, but I took a deep breath and just played. I made a few small mistakes, but mostly I played it correctly. The teacher smiled, and everyone clapped\! I felt so proud of myself for being brave enough to play. It feels good when you work hard at something and then do it well.

### **6.7 Feeling Bored**

It rained all afternoon, so I couldn't go outside to play. I finished my homework quickly, and then I didn't know what to do. I felt bored. I asked Mom if I could watch TV, but she said not yet. I tried reading, but I wasn't in the mood. Being bored is not fun. Eventually, my sister suggested playing a board game, which was a good idea. It helped pass the time.

### **6.8 A Bit Disappointed**

I was really looking forward to going to the park after school today, but my mom said we couldn't go because she had to work late. I felt disappointed. I had planned to meet my friends there. It's a shame when plans change. I understand Mom has to work, but I was still a bit down. Instead, I just played in the garden by myself for a while. Maybe we can go tomorrow.

### **6.9 Frustrated with Homework**

I was doing my English homework tonight, and I got really frustrated. There was one question I just couldn't figure out. I read it again and again, but I didn't understand what to do.

It's annoying when homework is too hard, but it feels good when you finally get it.

### **6.10 Feeling Grateful**

### **7.1 Fun at the Playground**

This afternoon, Mom took me and my sister to the playground near our house. It's a really nice park. I went straight to the swings and tried to swing as high as possible. Then, I played on the climbing frame. It was a bit challenging, but I made it to the top\! My sister loves the slide. We ran around playing tag for a while too. It felt good to get some fresh air and exercise after school.

### **7.2 Supermarket Trip**

I went to the supermarket with Dad after school today. We needed to buy groceries for the week. I got to push the cart, which I like doing. Dad had a list, and I helped him find things on the shelves. We bought fruits, vegetables, milk, and cereal. I asked if we could buy some ice cream, and Dad said yes\! Helping with the shopping makes me feel grown-up. It wasn't too busy today.

### **7.3 A Visit to the Library**

It was raining this morning, so Mom suggested we go to the library. I love the library\! It's so peaceful. I spent a long time looking at the children's books. I chose three books to borrow: one about space, one mystery story, and one comic book. My sister borrowed some picture books. We sat and read quietly for about half an hour before leaving. The library is a great place to spend a rainy day.

We visited my grandma today. She always makes a fuss of us\! As soon as we arrived, she offered us juice and her homemade cookies. Yummy\!

### **7.5 A Day at the Beach**

We went to the beach today because the weather was amazing\! It was so sunny and warm. First, we found a good spot and put down our towels. Then, my brother and I ran straight to the water.

I feel tired now but happy.

### **7.6 Trip to the Museum**

Our family visited the local history museum today. To be honest, I thought it might be a bit boring, but it was actually quite interesting\! There were old tools, clothes, and pictures from a long time ago. My favorite part was seeing the model of our town from 100 years ago. It looked so different\! We learned a lot about how people used to live. It's good to learn about the past.

### **7.7 Picnic in the Park**

We decided to have a picnic for lunch today. Mom packed sandwiches, fruit, chips, and juice. We took a blanket and went to the big park across town. We found a nice spot under a big tree. The food tasted even better outdoors\! After eating, we threw a frisbee around. It was so relaxing just lying on the blanket and watching the clouds. Picnics are a simple but fun way to spend an afternoon.

### **7.8 Feeding the Ducks**

We went for a walk by the river today. There's a spot where lots of ducks live. We brought some old bread crusts with us to feed them. The ducks got really excited when they saw us\! They swam over quickly and started quacking. It was funny to watch them gobble up the bread. We have to be careful not to give them too much, though. It was a nice, simple activity to do together.

### **7.9 Window Shopping**

Mom had to go into town to run some errands today, and I went with her. While she was busy, I did some window shopping. I looked in the windows of the toy store and the bookstore. There were so many cool things\! I saw a new LEGO set I really want. I didn't buy anything, but it was fun just to look around. Maybe I can save up my pocket money for that LEGO set.

### **7.10 Cafe Treat**

As a special treat after school today, Dad took me to a small cafe. We both ordered hot chocolate with whipped cream on top. It was delicious\! We sat by the window and watched people walk by.

### **7.11 Visiting the Pet Store**

We needed to buy some food for our cat, so we went to the pet store. I love going there because you can see all the animals\! They had fluffy rabbits, squeaky guinea pigs, and colorful fish. There was even a parrot that could talk a little bit\! I spent ages just watching the kittens playing. I wish we could get another pet, but Mom says one cat is enough. It's still fun to visit.

### **7.12 Going for Ice Cream**

It was really hot this afternoon, so Mom suggested we go get ice cream. Great idea\! We walked to the ice cream shop down the street. They have so many flavors. It was hard to choose\! In the end, I chose chocolate chip cookie dough. It was so yummy and refreshing. We sat outside the shop to eat it. Ice cream is the perfect treat on a hot day.

### **7.13 Exploring the Neighborhood**

My friend Maya and I decided to explore our neighborhood on our bikes today. We rode down some streets we don't usually go on. We discovered a little park we didn't know about\! It had different swings. We also saw a house with lots of garden gnomes, which was funny. It's fun to look around your own area and see what you can find. We had a good time being explorers.

### **7.14 Bus Ride Adventure**

Today, instead of driving, Mom and I took the bus into town. I don't go on the bus very often, so it felt like an adventure. I liked sitting by the window and watching everything go by. We had to press the button when we wanted to get off. It was much easier than I thought. Taking the bus is a different way to travel. It was kind of  fun for a change.

### **7.15 Farmer's Market Visit**

On Saturday morning, we went to the farmer's market. Lots of local farmers sell fresh fruit, vegetables, bread, and cheese there. It smelled really nice – like fresh strawberries and baked bread. We bought some apples, carrots, and a loaf of crusty bread. Everything looked so colorful and fresh. It's nice to buy food directly from the people who grow it. We'll have the bread for lunch. Yummy\!

The weather is a bit gloomy today. It's cloudy, and the sky is all grey. The sun hasn't come out at all. It doesn't feel very cold, but it's not bright and cheerful like yesterday.

### **8.6 Hot Summer Afternoon**

Phew, it's hot today\! Summer is definitely here. The sun is strong, and I feel sweaty just sitting still. We had the fan on all afternoon. Mom reminded me to drink lots of water.

### **8.7 Cold Winter Morning**

Brrr, it's cold today\! When I woke up, I could see frost on the grass outside. I had to wear warm clothes to school: a thick sweater, my winter coat, gloves, and a hat.

### **8.8 A Stormy Night**

There was a big storm last night\! I heard loud thunder and saw flashes of lightning outside my window. The wind was blowing hard, and the rain was pouring down. It was a little bit scary, but also kind of exciting. I snuggled under my covers. Storms are powerful\! This morning, the garden is very wet, and there are some small branches on the lawn. Luckily, the storm has passed now.

### **8.9 Foggy Morning Drive**

It was really foggy this morning when Dad drove me to school. It was hard to see very far ahead. The fog made everything look mysterious and quiet. Dad had to drive very slowly and be careful. It felt like we were driving through a cloud\! By the time school started, the sun had started to come out and the fog was lifting. It was quite strange to see.

### **8.10 Beautiful Rainbow**

After the rain this afternoon, something amazing happened\! A beautiful rainbow appeared in the sky. It had all the colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.
